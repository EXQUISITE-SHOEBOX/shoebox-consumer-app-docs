##  Relevant data
The internal Wetility team needs an IT Service Management (ITSM) system that is strong in the following areas


* Sales Automation


* Customer Service and CRM


* Field Service Management


* Asset Management




##  Background
Wetility operations has very tightly coupled workflows between the internal staff and customers, furthermore the different operations are also tightly coupled. As an example, asset management is strongly linked to CRM and Field Service management i.e. a technical agent could be sent to perform scheduled maintenance on specific equipment for a specific customer. For this reason it is important that the tooling that is used is also connected. A solution where the different processes do not speak to each other would be suboptimal. 


##  Options considered


|  |  **Option 1**  |  **Option 2**  |  **Option 3**  | 
| Zendesk | Freshworks | ServiceNow | 
|  This has already been adopted internally Zendesk is a mature product with a lot of support Zendesk is not optimised for Field Services (even though there are add-ons that allow it to do FieldServices) |  Freshworks has a suite of products that cover the different use cases Wetility needs natively There are other products within the suite that can be used in future to unlock new processes (e.g. marketing automation) Wetility team is not familiar with the product |  Highly customisable  Overly complex product for the type of usage needed Rare and expensive skills Expensive |
